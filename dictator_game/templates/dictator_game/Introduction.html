        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                You have been assigned the role of <strong>Allocator</strong> in this study. As an Allocator, your task is to decide how to allocate monetary bonuses between yourself and other participants (called Receivers).

        <h2>How Your Task is Structured</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p>Your task is divided into <strong>three parts</strong>, and in each part, you will play <strong>10 rounds</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In each round, you will decide how to allocate <strong>100 ECoins</strong> between yourself and a Receiver.</li>
                <li>Before each part, you will receive specific instructions about how to make your decisions.</li>
                <li>At the end of the experiment, <strong>one of the three parts will be randomly selected</strong> to determine your actual bonus payment in dollars.</li>
                <li>You will not know which part is selected until the study is complete, so please consider your decisions carefully in every part.</li>
                <li>The bonus payment will be transferred to you, within a week after you participate in the study, at a rate of 10 ECoins = 1 cent.</li>
                    
            </ul>

        <h2>Details About Each Part</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Part 1:</strong> You will set up an AI agent at the beginning of the part, and the AI will make all allocation decisions on your behalf for the 10 rounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 2:</strong> You will make every decision yourself in each of the 10 rounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Part 3:</strong> You will have the option to either make each decision yourself or delegate the decisions to an AI agent.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Specific instructions will be provided before the start of each part to guide you through the process.</p>

        <h2>How Each Round Works</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ol>
                <li>You will receive a total of <strong>100 ECoins</strong> for each round.</li>
                <li>In parts where you make the decisions, you will choose how much of the 100 ECoins you want to allocate to each Receiver you encounter in every round.</li>
                <li>In parts where an AI agent makes decisions, the agent (set up by you) will determine how to allocate the bonus in each round according to your preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Receivers are reshuffled between rounds.</strong> This means that in each round, you will be matched with a different Receiver, ensuring that every decision you make is independent of your interactions in previous rounds.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Important Details</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <ul>
                <li>The Receivers are other human participants who depend on your decisions to determine their bonuses.</li>
                <li>The decisions you make (or delegate to the AI) are entirely up to you. There are no right or wrong answers.</li>
                <li>Only one randomly selected part will be used to determine your bonus payment in dollars, but your decisions in all parts will contribute to the study.

        <h2>Anonymity</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
            <p>
                Your decisions will remain anonymous throughout the study. The Receivers will not know your identity, and you will not know theirs.

                After clicking <strong>“Continue”</strong>, you will be redirected to a <strong>Comprehension Test</strong>.
                This test is designed to assess how well you understood the task, so please read the instructions carefully before proceeding. If you fail the test more than <strong>three times</strong>, you will be excluded from the experiment. 
                For your convenience, the instructions will also appear again at the bottom of the Comprehension Test page.
